# Skye's Introduction

Hi, I’m Skye! I’m a developer and content creator with a passion for technology, creativity, and community building. I love exploring new ideas, sharing knowledge, and connecting with others who share my interests. Whether I’m designing websites, building cool things with code, or experimenting with new game modes, I’m always working on something fun.

One of my favorite projects is [SkyeNetwork](https://www.skyemc.net), a Minecraft server where I experiment with different features to create a fun and engaging experience for players. It’s open to the public — come join us at **play.skyemc.net**! You can also join the Discord at [discord.skyemc.net](https://discord.gg/xjS7VKmamB).

I hold several CompTIA certifications, including [ITF+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/it-fundamentals), [Tech+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/tech), and [Security+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security). I'm currently working toward my [Network+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/network) certification — with many more to come!
