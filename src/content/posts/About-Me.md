I love exploring new ideas, sharing knowledge, and connecting with others who share my interests. Whether it‚Äôs designing websites, building cool things with code, or experimenting with new game modes, I‚Äôm always creating something.

One of my favorite projects is [SkyeNetwork](https://www.skyemc.net), a Minecraft server I run where I experiment with different features to make a fun and engaging experience for players. It‚Äôs open to the public ‚Äî come join us at **play.skyemc.net** you can join the discord at [discord.skyemc.net](https://discord.gg/xjS7VKmamB)!
